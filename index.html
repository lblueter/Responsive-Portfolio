      <p>Hello! My name is Logan Blueter, I am an aspiring web developer from Ohio. I graduated from Highland Highschool in 2013.
          I currently live with my parents and my two younger sisters. We have two dogs and two cats. My father
          was in the Army for six years working with network security and we have always been big into computers
          and technology. When I was younger my dad and I made a website for our family together thought he
          did most the work and I just picked out pictures and old flash games to embed in the page. That was
          my first experience with web design and I have been interested since then. Though I havenâ€™t had much
          experience coding I have had much experience with computer software and hardware and know the basics.
          I have built my own computer and have setup my own network as well as doing the same for various
          friends and family. Much of what I know is thanks to my family and I owe a lot to them. I am currently
          looking forward to the new knowledge and experience I am going to gain at the Case Western Reserve
          University Coding Bootcamp. Someday I hope to make a great career out of the skills I am going to
          be learning over the next 6 months.</p>
